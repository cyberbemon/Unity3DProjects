# Unity3DProjects
This repo contains some of the projects I've done using Unity3D both educational/hobby.
Here are the list of projects. 

* AStarPathFinding - A very basic implementation of A* pathfinding in Unity.
* AStarPathFindingHeapOptimized - A* pathfinding with heap optimization.
* UnitySpaceShooter - W.I.P game, where the player shoots asteroids or enemies. Did it as a part of unity training.
